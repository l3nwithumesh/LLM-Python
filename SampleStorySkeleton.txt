Story happens in Pune, Maharashtra, India
Roadside tea vendor found two notes of US$100 in the morning as he was opening his stall. It is big amount in Indian Rupees. $1=84 INR. Doesn't know the currency, so keeps it on the side as he goes about doing business.

A regular customer comes by and while paying for his cup of tea sees the dollars. Congratulates the vendor for getting so much in foreign currency. Vendor tells him he does not own this money but found it near his tea stall in the morning. The customer tells him to hold it to see if someone comes to collect or else call police to handover the money as he cannot hold on to foreign currency. Vendor says a cop comes for tea around 4 pm, will tell him if nobody claims it.

Cop comes in for his cup of tea at usual time and vendor tells him about the currency he has found. Cop says, there was a foreigner who had actually called the police about his wallet getting lost. Calls the station and station contacts the complainant. Complainant says, yes he walked by that road yesterday night but does not remember seeing the tea stall. Cop searches nearby and finds the wallet a few yards away with more currency and id in it.

Foreigner James is called to the tea stall and he identifies the wallet, says it had about $1000. But he is happy that at least the wallet has $800. The cop tells him the tea vendor had found $200 and told him. He hands James the $200 that the tea stall owner had found. James surprised and happy, offers $100 to the tea stall vendor as a token of gratitude. The vendor politely refuses saying "he did not earn it!" and offers James tea. 
James thanks the cop and the vendor. Asks if he can take a photo with the tea vendor and the cop.
Says, he is going to write about it in his local news paper with a quote of thanks.
