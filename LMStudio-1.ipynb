      "\n",
      "*   **Privacy:** Running a local LLM means your data stays on *your* machine. This is crucial for sensitive information, confidential projects, or situations where you don't want to rely on sending data to external servers.\n",
      "*   **Control:** You have complete control over the model’s behavior, updates, and how it’s used.  You aren’t subject to changes made by a third-party provider.\n",
      "*   **Cost Savings (Potentially):** While initial setup might require some resources, running a local LLM can eliminate ongoing API usage fees that come with cloud-based services, especially for high-volume use.\n",
      "*   **Offline Access:** You can utilize the model even without an internet connection – perfect for remote locations or situations where connectivity is unreliable.\n",
      "*   **Customization & Fine-tuning:**  Because you have access to the model weights, you can fine-tune it on your own specific datasets to improve its performance and tailor it to your unique needs.\n",
