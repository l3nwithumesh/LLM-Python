      "\n",
      "*   **Privacy:** Because the model runs on your own hardware, your data stays local. This is crucial for sensitive information like personal documents, financial records, or proprietary business data – it doesn’t need to be sent to a remote server.\n",
      "*   **Control:** You have complete control over the model and its usage. You can customize it, fine-tune it on your own datasets, and ensure it aligns with your specific needs and values.\n",
      "*   **Reduced Latency:** Processing happens locally, eliminating network delays and providing faster response times. This is particularly important for real-time applications.\n",
      "*   **Offline Access:**  You can use the model even without an internet connection – perfect for situations where connectivity is unreliable or unavailable.\n",
      "*   **Cost Savings (Potentially):** Depending on your usage patterns, running a local LLM can be more cost-effective than relying on cloud-based APIs, especially for high-volume applications.\n",
